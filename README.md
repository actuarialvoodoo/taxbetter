This project aims to quantify the impact of not having the IRS caculate taxes for simple returns. I'm doing this in response to
the Taxpayers First bill (H.R. 1959), which forbids the IRS from creating software to compete with Turbotax and it's competitors ([Vox article](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/9/18301943/last-minute-tax-preparation-h-r-block-turbotax)).
I plan to create a dashboard for each congressional district.
